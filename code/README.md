Here you'll find all the code and the technical stuff. Feel free to make the changes to best fit your necessities. Let me show you arround!

## Architecture

## Tests

Tests are really important in any code development, that's why there are tests for most of the .py files. The script that runs all of the tests is the `runAllTests.sh`. Everytime you change something from the existing code, make sure all the tests pass. When implementing new tests, do not forget to include the new files in the `runAllTests.sh` scripts, so we can all enjoy a great continuous development!
