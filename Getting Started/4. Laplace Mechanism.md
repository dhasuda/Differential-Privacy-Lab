# The Laplace Mechanism

## Definition
This mechanism is simply a type of Exponential Mechanism, which makes it easier to be understood.

To get to the Laplacian Mechanism, we first use the Exponential Mechanism, but with a defined scoring function. Consider the following scoring function: f(𝑥 ,𝑟)=−2|𝑥−𝑟|

In this scoring function, we are saying that the output 𝑟=𝑥 is the best for the output. This implies that the format (structure) of the output and the input are the same. If the input is an array of ten zeros, for instance, the best output is the same array of then zeros.

With that, we can define the mechanism as respecting this equation:

𝑃[ℳ(𝑥, f,𝜀)=𝑟] ∝ exp⁡(−𝜀|𝑥−𝑟|/∆)

With a little of effort and math, it's possible to get to this other form to define the Laplacian Mechanism:

ℳ(𝑥, f,𝜀)=𝑥+(𝑌_1,…,𝑌_𝑘)

where 𝑌_𝑖 are independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from 𝐿𝑎𝑝(∆⁄𝜀)

## Laplace Distribution
Just as aditional context, the Laplace Distribution (with mean zero) can be written as:

𝐿𝑎𝑝(𝑥│𝑏)=1/2𝑏 exp⁡(−(|𝑥|)/𝑏)

And that's the reason this mechanism is known as the Laplacian Mechanism.

## Privacy

As this mechanism is simple a kind of Exponential Mechanism, we can say by extent that the Laplacian Mechanism is 𝜀-differentially private.
